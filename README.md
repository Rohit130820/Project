# Property Dealing Website - Manual Testing

This project is focused on **manual testing** for the Property Dealing Website. The goal is to outline how to create detailed **test cases**, **test scenarios**, **mind maps**, and **bug reports**. This approach ensures all features are thoroughly tested and bugs are identified.

## Features to Test

- **Property Listings**: Test the functionality of property listings, including displaying accurate information.
- **Search Functionality**: Ensure the search bar and filters work as expected.
- **User Registration and Login**: Test the user registration and login system.
